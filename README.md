# FPGA-Based Image Processing and VGA Display

## **Overview**
This project implements **real-time image processing** on an **Artix-7 FPGA board** and displays processed images on a VGA monitor. The system supports filters such as **image negative**, **grayscale**, and **color thresholding**, with real-time adjustment via FPGA switches. Python is used for preprocessing, Vivado for FPGA design and synthesis, and the final output is displayed on a VGA monitor.
